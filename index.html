<h1> Welcome to the Everest Github page,<br/> we’re glad you could join us here.</h1>

<div>
Everest is a decentralized value exchange platform<br/>
with built-in KYC made up of three components: <br/>
EverID, EverWallet and EverChain.<br/>
</div>

<img src="Everestdotorg.github.io/img/EverID_noBorder_500x500.png" alt="EverID" width="200" height="200">
<div>
  <strong>EverID</strong> - biometrically based identification encompassing user biometry, <br/>
institutional attestations and claims, and community endorsements. <br/>
All identity elements are atomically shareable, traceable, and verifiable.<br/>
</div>

<img src="Everestdotorg.github.io/img/EverWallet_noBorder_500x500.png" alt="EverWallet" width="200" height="200">
<div>
  <strong>EverWallet</strong> - a digital wallet that is able to store both tokens as well as<br/>
documents, and to exchange tokens or documents with other instances of EverWallet.<br/>
</div>

<img src="Everestdotorg.github.io/img/EverChain_noBorder_500x500.png" alt="EverChain" width="200" height="200">
<div>
  <strong>EverChain</strong> - a private, permissioned Ethereum blockchain which is designed<br/>
to scale in both speed and block height. <br/>
<p></p>
<div>
  At Everest, we believe in developing “Openly Proprietary” solutions which leverage open <br/>
  source software in a proprietary software stack. Why do we do this - it is truly the best<br/>
  of both closed source and open source software. We are strong proponents of the open source<br/>
  software movement, and contribute back to those projects we utilize, however, there are <br/>
  certain elements of our solution which are so sensitive that we should keep those secret. <br/>
</div>
<p></p>
<div>
  This is a very similar approach to Apple Inc. They built their operating system above BSD, <br/>
  a well known open source project, however, included a series of innovations above BSD which <br/>
  they have kept private. They continue to contribute to open source projects that they utilize, <br/>
  but do not release all of their software under Open Source licenses.<br/>
