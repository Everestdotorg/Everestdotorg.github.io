<h1> Welcome to the Everest OSS page, we’re glad you could join us here.</h1>

<h2>
<p>Everest is a decentralized value exchange platform</p>
<p>with built-in KYC made up of three components: </p>
<p>EverID, EverWallet and EverChain.</p>
<p></p>
<img src="Everestdotorg.github.io/img/EverID_noBorder_500x500.png" alt="EverID">
<p><bold>EverID</bold> - biometrically based identification encompassing user biometry, </p>
<p>institutional attestations and claims, and community endorsements. </p>
<p>All identity elements are atomically shareable, traceable, and verifiable.</p>
  <p></p>
<img src="Everestdotorg.github.io/img/EverWallet_noBorder_500x500.png" alt="EverID">
<p><bold>EverWallet</bold> - a digital wallet that is able to store both tokens as well as</p>
<p>documents, and to exchange tokens or documents with other instances of EverWallet.</p>
<p></p>
<img src="Everestdotorg.github.io/img/EverChain_noBorder_500x500.png" alt="EverID">
<p><bold>EverChain</bold> - a private, permissioned Ethereum blockchain which is designed</p>
<p>to scale in both speed and block height. </p>
<p></p>
<p>At Everest, we believe in developing “Openly Proprietary” solutions which leverage open </p>
<p>source software in a proprietary software stack. Why do we do this - it is truly the best</p>
<p>of both closed source and open source software. We are strong proponents of the open source</p>
<p>software movement, and contribute back to those projects we utilize, however, there are </p>
<p>certain elements of our solution which are so sensitive that we should keep those secret. </p>
<p></p>
<p>This is a very similar approach to Apple Inc. They built their operating system above BSD, </p>
<p>a well known open source project, however, included a series of innovations above BSD which </p>
<p>they have kept private. They continue to contribute to open source projects that they utilize, </p>
<p>but do not release all of their software under Open Source licenses.</p>
